"""MCP client factory: connects to the MCP tool server and returns LangChain tools.

Tools are loaded once at app startup in lifespan() and injected into the
react_researcher node via compile_graph(). This avoids reconnecting on every
node invocation and keeps the MCP connection alive for the app's lifetime.

Note: MultiServerMCPClient does NOT support async context manager as of 0.1.x.
Instantiate directly and await get_tools() — do not use async with.

Example usage (in lifespan):
    mcp_tools = await load_mcp_tools(settings.mcp_server_url)
    app.state.graph = compile_graph(checkpointer, build_llm(), mcp_tools)
