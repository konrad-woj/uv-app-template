"""Planner + plan_review nodes: generate a research plan, then pause for human approval.

Split into two nodes because LangGraph re-executes a node's entire function body
from the top on every resume — only the *return value* is checkpointed, not
progress within the function. A single node that generates the plan and then
calls interrupt() would regenerate the plan (a fresh, nondeterministic LLM call)
every time the graph resumes, so the plan the user approved in the interrupt
payload could differ from the plan actually used afterward. Splitting avoids
that: all nondeterministic work happens in `planner`, which returns before any
interrupt; `plan_review` does nothing but read the already-computed plan from
state and call interrupt() — safe to re-run on resume since it has no side effects.

Demonstrates the LangGraph interrupt() pattern:
  1. planner: LLM generates a plan, then GLiGuard (injection/content check) + LLM
     quality check guard it. If unsafe: returns status="blocked" WITHOUT calling
     interrupt() — the unsafe plan is never surfaced to the user.
  2. plan_review: if the plan was safe, calls interrupt({"plan": plan}) — graph
     suspends here, checkpointed. Resume guard and search run on resumption.
  3. Caller resumes with Command(resume=True) → plan_approved=True → routes to resume_guard.
  4. Caller resumes with Command(resume=False) → plan_approved=False → routes to END (aborted).

Both nodes are wrapped with with_dead_letter so any error routes to dead_letter.
